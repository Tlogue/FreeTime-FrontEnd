        <h1>A little about myself</h1>
        <p>My name is Tyler and I currently reside in beautiful Colorado (available to relocate for work). I received my Associates in Computer Science on May 25, 2024 and am filled with the drive to further myself in the tech field. What's a little bit interesting is before I began my Comp Sci career path, I was going to school to become a Radiology Technologist at Pikes Peak Community College. However, I gained my CNA license as I truly do care about others and want us to live healthy long lives. After working sometimes as a CNA I had gained an enormous amount of respect for that field of work, but understood that it was something that I couldn't do for a living.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I am a dog lover and would like to open up a shelter for dogs one day that would allow for dogs to stay freely until adopted. But I would want the facility to hire animal lovers who are actively looking to walk, assist with sanitary efforts, and other necessary efforts.</p>
